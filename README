# Bakery Story Calculator

A simple calculator for the popular mobile game, Bakery Story. Keep track of your recipes and ingredients with ease.

## Getting Started

Once you've downloaded the files, simply launch the `bakery.html` file in your browser to start using the Bakery Story Calculator. 

### Adding Recipes

Recipes are stored in an array within the code, so if you want to add additional recipes, you'll need to add them to the recipes array in the code.

### Console App Version

If you prefer a console-based version of the app, there's a `BakeryScriptBETA.js` file included as well. This version reads recipes from a text file.
you will need to run "npm install readline-sync" in order for the app to read from the txt files
if you want to add more recipes to the txt files you can add a new line with the following separated by spaces:
Name, Cost to make, Selling Price, Quantity, Time to make(minutes)
